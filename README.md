# SpyDir
Crawls in local machines directories and saves them to display later.

Overview
The Directory Crawler and File Display project provides a Python script and GUI application to crawl through directories on a local machine, save the file information into a pickle file, and then display the files in a user-friendly manner. This project is useful for organizing and browsing through a large number of files on a computer.

Warning: Use this tool responsibly and only on a computer that you own or have permission to access. Do not use it on systems without proper authorization.

Features
Crawling: The get_all_files.py script recursively explores directories on the local machine and retrieves each files name and their path. It gathers this data and saves it into a pickle file for later use.
Saving: The gathered file information is saved into a pickle file format, which allows for easy loading and retrieval of the data. The pickle file serves as a persistent storage for the file information, eliminating the need for repeated crawling.
Displaying: The display_dir.pyw GUI application loads the pickle file generated by the crawling script and provides a user-friendly interface to browse through the files.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/seferi16/SpyDir.git.

Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your machine.

Install the required Python dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the project directory.

Usage
To crawl and save the file information, run the get_all_files.py script. This will gather all file in the machine regardless its OS.
To display the files, run the display_dir.pyw script. Then load the previously generated pickle file and open the GUI application. Use the intuitive interface to navigate through the directory structure, search for files, and apply filters as needed.
